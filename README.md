# Short_Course_GRC_2020
A hands-on Bioinformatics short course for WFH grad and undergrad students. Stay well and stay strong! 

Session I Title: Bioinformatics in R with an example in RNA-Seq downstream visualization and functional analysis

Description: This is a practical short course to help you extract biological meanings from RNA-Seq gene expression data. We practice simple R scripts to filter candidate genes, check replicate consistency, draw venn diagrams and heatmaps, and perform GO/KEGG enrichment analysis. It helps to streamline your work from tabular results to publishable figures without bouncing between different programming languages. Pre-installation of R/RStudio with Bioconductor, edgeR, dplyr and ggplot2 packages is needed (a guide will be provided).
